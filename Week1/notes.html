            <h1>Week 1</h1>

                    <li>Syllabus</li>
                    <li>Then read through the sections on Localstorage in Doing Stuff with Web Things. 
                        (Starts in section 2.3, p35). The rest of the book should be review.</li>

                    <li>Watch the video Master Mobile UX on Sitepoint</li>

            <h2>Notes</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>I don't know how to use the command line very well. I feel like it has been 
                        mentioned in a few classes but never taught how to use it. I probably should 
                        have learned on my own time already.</li>
                    <li>Think, Design, Test, Create-take the time to think out necessary steps, 
                        design parts that might be problamatic to me, test those designs, create 
                        the whole product.</li>
                    <li>JavaScript is a weakness for me and I REALLY need to focus on it. I had planned 
                        to take the time over break to learn more but we ended up having Covid and 
                        barely functioning.</li>
                    <li>Three good parts to a web page: HTML-define what is on the page, CSS-pretty the 
                        page up, JavaScript-make the experience interactive versus passive.</li>
                    <li>I love that everyone says programmers are lazy...I just like to think of it as efficient. :)</li>
                    <li>Having the JavaScript examples broken down in the LocalStorage section of the reading 
                        is helping me to process what happens and why. Hopefully if I get stuck on this in the future I 
                        will remember to go back and re-read this. </li>
                    <li>Think of situations that will cause problems and take care of it before users are able to 
                        access your code. If you don't do this then you will end up looking unintelligent. 
                    </li>
                    <li>Box Shadows: first value is horizontal shift, second is vertical shift, third is blur pixels, 
                        fourth is color hexidecimal and fifth is if it is inset or something else. </li>
                    <li>Start with the simplest device and then add to it for more complex devices. </li>
                    <li>Mobile first when designing. There are downsides but there are more upsides to it. 
                        Biggest of all it is a better experience for the user.</li>
                    <li>Mobile is not a fad and is not going away. </li>
                    <li></li>
                    <li></li>
