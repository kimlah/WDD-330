        <h1>Exercise 5-A Modular Robot</h1>
            <h2>How would I write this modular program?</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>roads</li>
                    <li>buildGraph</li>
                    <li>roadGraph</li>
                    <li>VillageState</li>
                    <li>runRobot</li>
                    <li>randomPick</li>
                    <li>randomRobot</li>
                    <li>mailRoute</li>
                    <li>routeRobot</li>
                    <li>findRoute</li>
                    <li>goalOrientedRobot</li>
                </ul>

            <h2>My Plan to Write the Modular Program</h2>
                <p>The first thing I notice is that there are a few things that could inherit from a similar function or class. 
                    I would create graph, random, route, and robot functions.
                </p>
                <p>From there I would create the buildGraph and roadGraph functions. I'm assuming the roads function would work 
                    in there somwhere but I'm not sure where yet. From the random function I would create the randomPick and randomRobot
                    functions. The route function would make it easier to write the mailRoute, routeRobot and findRoute functions. The 
                    runRobot, randomRobot, routeRobot and goalOrientedRobot would all inherit from the robot function.
                </p>
                <p>I don't know much about NPM packages but at first glace it seems like there could be a lot of resources there once I 
                    pick through it for what I need. I feel like it would be a toss up for time whether finding an appropriate NPM 
                    package or writing my own.</p>
