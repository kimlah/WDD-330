                <h3>JavaScript: Novice to Ninja - Chapter 8: Forms</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>form element has controls like input fields, select menus, buttons, etc.</li>
                        <li>form.reset() resets the form controls to what the initial value was. Or button type='reset'</button></li>
                        <li>form.action = 'url' sends the form to a different URL.</li>
                        <li>Adding a placeholder seems to take less work than adding an input value to the text box. It also seems like 
                            it would be less work for the user.</li>
                        <li>Form Control types: input, select, textarea, button</li>
                        <li>Making input type='password' makes it so that the password is concealed instead of regular text.</li>
                        <li>Other input types include number, tel, color, date, email, </li>
                    </ul>
                <h3>JavaScript: Novice to Ninja - Chapter 12: Object Oriented Programming</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>OOP is often used to model real world objects.</li>
                        <li>The three main concepts in OOP are: encapsulation, polymorphism, and inheritance.</li>
                        <li>In the reading a juicer is used as an example of a real world object, it has properties and 
                            methods/actions that it can preform. Encapsulation: put the fruit in, turn on, and out comes 
                            the juice. The inner workings are hidden inside the object and only the essential functions 
                            are exposed. The essential functionality in this case is the on button. This makes it simple 
                            to call the "on" function without having to have the user tell the juicer each step of the 
                            juicing process. Polymorphism: various objects can share the same method just like appliances 
                            plug in, usually have an on switch, have buttons, etc. They have the ability to have different 
                            methods/functions with more specific information. Inheritance: the new and improved juicer can 
                            do more things but probably has the same guts. Inheritance is the same in that it can take the 
                            features from something else and apply it to something else.</li>
                        <li>Even though JS now uses classes, it still uses prototype inheritance in teh background.</li>
                        <li>Some of JS's built in constructor functions are Object, Array, and Function that can be used 
                            to create objects, arrays and functions instead of literals.</li>
                        <li>The ".constructor" property will return the function that created it.</li>
                        <li>A static method can only be called by the class it was created in and cannot be inherited.</li>
                        <li>To find the prototype of an object use Object.getPrototypeOf() method. The object is the parameter.</li>
                        <li>Object.hasOwnProperty('') can be used to return a boolean for if it is it's own property or 
                            inherited from the prototype.</li>
                        <li>Overwriting prototype properties is as easy as reassigning.</li>
                        <li>Never use arrays or objects as a default value in prototype.</li>
                        <li>There is a prototype chain that goes all teh way back to the Object() constructor function. If 
                            I call a method, if it isn't in the nearest prototype then the search continues back to object().</li>
                        <li>Using extends is better practice because in the case of the turtle class, it could be used for normal 
                            turtles and then be extended for ninja turtles, sea turtles, etc with things that only apply to 
                            certain objects.</li>
                        <li>Polymorphism means that objects can inherit the same method but use it in different ways.</li>
                        <li>When using console.log numbers are automatically changed to a string with toString.</li>
                    </ul>
                <h3>JavaScript: Novice to Ninja - Chapter 15: Section on Modular JavaScript</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>A module is a self contained piece of code. It provides function and methods that can be used 
                            in other places such as other files and modules. This makes code resuable, easier to maintain and more accesible.</li>
                        <li>Coupling is used to describe how dependent two codes are on each other. The more tightly coupled codes will most 
                            likely require changes to both codes if one needs to be changed. Loosly coupled codes are able to npt be 
                            modified as much or at all if the other code is changed.</li>
                        <li>Modules have their own global scope and can only be accessed in the range of their scope.</li>
                    </ul>
                <h3>Questions</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>The example in Ch15 on modules didn't work for me. When I tried importing Pi from the other js file an error says that I 
                            cannot import oustide of a module.</li>
                        <li>Why do numbers need to be a string when displayed with console.log? </li>
                    </ol>
