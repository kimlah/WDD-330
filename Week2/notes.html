            <h2>Notes</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Variable keywords bind the object to the statement. Binding can be changed at any point by redefining 
                        the statement. I love the octopus example in the Eloquent JavaScript reading: bindings do not contain 
                        values but grasp them like an octopus grasps an object. Two tentacles can hold the same value but it 
                        can also let go and grab something new.
                    </li>
                    <li>One let statement can define more than one "binding" if the bound pairs are separrated by a comma.</li>
                    <li>I want to look into the "Math." options so that I know what is already avilable for use. 
                        I don't want to make more work for myself than is necessary.</li>
                    <li>"//" is for single line comments, "/* */" is for multi line comments.</li>
                    <li>The syntax used by JavaScript is called C-style because it has similarities with the C programming 
                        language. What is C used for? What does it do that other programming languages don't? What can't C do?</li>
                    <li>JS has 7 data types. The 6 primitive data types are string, symbol, number, boolean, undefined and null. 
                        Any value that isn't one of the 6 primitive data types is an object. --- typeof is a JS operator to find 
                        out the type of a value. "typeof 'hello'" is an example of how to use it.
                    </li>
                    <li>const declares a variable that cannot be changes while let declares a variable that can be updated, 
                        reassigned, etc. Const and let variables only exist in the block they are declared in. Try not to use var anymore.</li>
                    <li>Be careful of how variables are declared so that they are not global when local is needed or vis versa.</li>
                    <li>".length", ".toUpperCase()", "to LowerCase()", ".charAt(#)" (tells character in mentioned position), ".indexOf('#')" 
                        (finds where a certain character is in the string). ".lastIndexOf('#')" (same as .indexOf but the last occurance 
                        instead of the first. There are so many cool wrappers that have already been created to make programming smoother, 
                        quicker and more effective.</li>
                    <li>It is strange to be introduced to symbols but not be given much information on them. If I have time I will look into it.</li>
                    <li>Integers are whole numbers, floats are decimals. I mix these up often but it is so straight foreward. Maybe I'll get it straight 
                        one of these days. toFixed() is such a useful tool to use with floats or when dividing especially.
                    </li>
                    <li>NaN - error value for not a number. It is the result of not using numbers or numbers as a string.</li>
                    <li>Check if a value is a number by using Number.isFinite(). It will return true if teh number isn't Infinity, -Infinity or NaN.</li>
                    <li>Check into TypeScript! Is it worht using?</li>
                    <li>Double equals (==) is soft equality and doesn't pay as much attention to the data type. Triple equals (===) is hard equality 
                        and only returns true if the data type is correct. 
                    </li>
                    <li>Array-ordered list of values. const myArray = []; To access a specific value in the array type myArray[6]. To assign an element 
                        in the array: myArray[7] = 'Oreo Fudge'; It can be changed by reassigning the array position.
                    </li>
                    <li>Array Literals-create array with some of the elements initially so as to not have to add later. const avengers = ['Capitan America', 
                        'Iron Man', 'Thor', 'Hulk'];
                    </li>
                    <li>The join() method seems useful to take an array list as a whole and then could be seperated to use without recreating.</li>
                    <li>reverse() reverses the array permanantly. sort() sorts the array in alphabetical order.</li>
                    <li>Multidimentional arrays seems really cool! I feel like it will take a few times of using one for it to make more sense but besides 
                        accessing the values it doesn't seem too complicated. 
                    </li>
                    <li>Sets cannot have duplicates. const list = new Set(); is how to create a set. Use the add() method to add values to a set: list.add(1); 
                        An array can be added to a set to get rid of duplicates. Sets so not have index notation.
                    </li>
                    <li>Thw while loop example of the bottles decreasing is very interesting. I hadn't thought about decreasing the number before the loop instead of after.</li>
                    <li>do...while loops will always run once because the while condition is checked after the do loop.</li>
                    <li>I like the outline for the for loop: for (initialization ; condition ; after) { do something }, I always have a hard 
                        time remembering the necessary parts of a for loop.</li>
                    <li>If too few parameters are given when using a function then it returns NaN because it cannot process the function correctly. If it has too 
                        many parameters then it ignores the extra parameters.
                    </li>
                    <li>function rest(...args){return args;} is used to create an array of arguments that are available inside the function body.</li>
                    <li>=> is for declaring functions. parameters come before the arrow and the main body comes after the arrow. They are anonymas so to 
                        give it a name I would need to do something like this.  "const square = x => x*x;".
                    </li>
                </ul>
