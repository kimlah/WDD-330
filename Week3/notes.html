                <h3>Object Methods: this & This in JavaScript</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Action sin the real world are represented by functions in JavaScript.</li>
                        <li>When writing code with objects used to represent things it is called OOP or object oriented programming.</li>
                        <li>Books to look into to better understand OOP: “Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software” 
                            by E. Gamma, R. Helm, R. Johnson, J. Vissides or “Object-Oriented Analysis and Design with Applications” by G. Booch</li>
                        <li>It sounds like "this" is acble to be used in any function with ".onjectName" following it to access 
                            the assignment of that object it.</li>
                        <li>Arrow functions have no "this" but if used then this is called from the outer function.</li>
                        <li>There are 6 ways that this can take on values: 1-in global contex (wouldn't be used in this contex), 2-in object construction 
                            (this referes to the instance of an object), 3-in an object method (method is a fancy word for a function associated with an 
                            object), 4-in a simple function (), 5-in an arrow function and 6-in an event listener.</li>
                        <li></li>
                        <li></li>
                        <li></li>
                        <li></li>
                        <li></li>
                        <li></li>
                    </ul>
                <h3>Chapter 5: Objects</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Everything in JAvaScripit is either one of the six primitive data types or an object.</li>
                        <li>An object is a self contained set of values and functions that are related. They are used to map strings, numbers, arrays and 
                            functions. It's like a dictionary that has a property <i>name</i> with it's "definition" or value.</li>
                        <li>Object literal outline: const family = {name: 'Imlah', husband: 'Spencer', wife: 'Keeley', children: ['Kyla', 'Wyatt', 'Whitney'],
                            married: true. sealed: true, motto() {return 'We don't have a motto';}};</li>
                        <li>To create an object: const name = {}</li>
                        <li>Accessing Properties family.name in my example would return 'Imlah'.</li>
                        <li>family.motto() and family['motto'] would both return 'We don't have a motto'.</li>
                        <li>To check is a property or method exists in an object I would say 'daughter' in family; which would return false.</li>
                        <li>If I wanted to add a city to my example: family.city = 'Arlington'; If we moved I could change the city location by: family['city'] = 
                            'Meridian'; To deleter the motto since we don't have one I would add delete family.motto</li>
                        <li>The namespacing seems like a great idea! Working in teams seems like a common practice with programming so allowing 
                            everyone to use the names that makes sense to them while allowing repeats is genious.</li>
                        <li>JSON parse() returns a JS object from the string of data. stringify() does the opposite and returns a JSON string from a JS object.</li>
                        <li>Math. constants are in capital letters. 1-PI, 2-SQRT2 the square root of 2, 3-SQRT1_2 reciprical of the square root of 2, 4-E Euler's 
                            constant, 5-LN2 natural log of 2, 6-LN10 natural log of 10, 7-LOG2E log base 2 of Euler's Constant, 8-LOG10E log base 10 of Euler's Constant.</li>
                        <li>Math has lots of methods like .abs for absolute value, .ceil for rounding up to the next integer, .floor for rounding down to the next integer, 
                            .round to round to the nearest integer, .trunc to return the integer part of a number. I'm sure there is a long list on W3schools that I can 
                            print with all of the math methods.
                        </li>
                        <li>moment.js library gives a large number of methods to work with dates easier.</li>
                    </ul>
                <h3>Chapter 6: Document Object Model</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Numerical code of Nodes: 1-element, 2-attribute, 3-text, 8-comment, 9-body.</li>
                        <li>When checking the nodeName it is returned in all caps.</li>
                        <li>Document.body returns the body element of a web page. Document.images returns a node list of images in the document. 
                            Document.links returns a node list of "a href" elements in the document. Document.anchors returns a node list of "a" 
                            elements with a name attribute. Document.forms returns a node list of the forms in the document. 
                        </li>
                        <li>Nodes are not arrays but are array-like. Items can be accessed using index notation, can use the length property but 
                            cannot slice, splice or join. It can be easily turned into an array by using "Array.from(document.images);" for example.</li>
                        <li>An id attribute needs to be unique for each one. I know I have mixed this up a few times and made a 
                            class and id have the same name, it messed me up for quite a while trying to figure out what was wrong.</li>
                        <li>I never think to use these shortcuts, for lack of a better word, in the console to find things in my documents. It's so convenient!</li>
                        <li>document.querySelector() searches for the first item that matches while document.querySelectorAll() returns a node list of 
                            ALL items that match. .querySelector could be used in place of .getElementById(). .querySelectorAll() could be used in place of 
                            document.getElementByClassName.</li>
                        <li>.getAttribute('class') or teh attribute provided.</li>
                        <li>appendChild adds an element to the end of a list. insertBefore(newElement, moveElement) will place an element before the specified element. 
                            removeChild(elementName) is used to remove an element from the page. replaceChild(oldText, newText); can be used to rename an element or 
                            replace it all together.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                <h3>Chapter 7: Events</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Event listeners-I liked the example given in the reading but I also thought another fitting example is a doorbell. We could sit at the 
                            door all day waiting for someone or something or we could listen for the doorbell or a knock to alert us and then act once it happens.</li>
                        <li>document.body.addEventListener("click", doSomething); is used when we want to flag a certain action instead of running an if loop over and over.</li>
                        <li>Event listeners are the current standard. </li>
                        <li>Properties screenX and screenY  show the number of pixels from the top left of the screen where the event took place.</li>
                        <li>Properties clientX and clientY show the number of pixels from the top left of the 'client' that is being used (usually browser window).</li>
                        <li>Properties pageX and pageY show the number of pixels from the left and top (respectively) where the event took place in a <b>document</b>. 
                            This takes into account if teh page as been scrolled.</li>
                        <li>Mouse Events-click, mousedown, mouseup, dblclick. Do not use click and dblclick on the same element because doing so will cause both to fire.</li>
                        <li>Keyboard Events-keydown, keypress, and keyup. Occur in order listed but are not tied to any key in particular. keydown occurs when key is 
                            pressed and continues to occur if it is held down. keypress occurs after a keydown event but before a keyup. keypress only occurs for 
                            keys that produce character input and teh delete key. keyup occurs when a key is released. </li>
                        <li>Modifier Keys-shift, alt, ctrl and meta(cmd on mac) fire keydown and keyup but not a keypress event because no characters are produced on the screen.</li>
                        <li>Touch Events- smartphones, tablets and touch screen monitors all use touch events. touchstart occurs when user initially touches the surface. A touchstart 
                            event can interfere with usability if it fires when a user just wants to zoom, swipe, etc. click is a safer option to use because it still fires when the 
                            screen is touched but it has a 300ms delay which allows the user to do something else. touchend occurs when the user stops touching the surface. touchmove 
                            events occur when a user touches the screen and then moves around without leaving the screen. touchenter is when a user is touching the surface and then 
                            passes over an event with an event listener. touchleave occurs when the user is touching the surface but leaves the element the event listener is attatched 
                            to. touchcancel event is when a touch event is interupted like too many fingers, fingers moving off the screen, etc.</li>
                        <li>Touch events have properties called touches. Use touch events with caution.</li>
                        <li>Event listeners can be removed using removeEventListener().</li>
                        <li>Bubbling-when an event fires on the element clicked on first, then bubbles up the document tree, firing or 'touching' each node until it reaches the root 
                            node. Default method over capturing but both can be used.</li>
                        <li>Capturing-starts by firing an event on teh root element, then moves down, firing on each child element until it reaches the target element that was clicked on.</li>
                    </ul>
                <h3>Questions</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Why don't programs like VScode have spell check? I'm figuring it's because the elements would throw it off. Would there be a way to program around that? I can't 
                            be the only person who would love to have spell check versus typing in word and transfering over. </li>
                        <li>Is the quiz ninja something that you are hoping we will do? I've been doing other exercises to practice but I also think it would be good in the midterm and 
                            final portfolio.</li>
