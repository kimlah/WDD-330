                <h3>JavaScript: Novice to Ninja - Chapter 9: The Window Object</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Browser Object Model or BOM is a collection of properties and methods, available through the window object, that contain 
                            information about the browser and computer screen. </li>
                        <li>Dialogs: alert(), confirm(), prompt() are three functions that produced dialogs in the browsers.</li>
                        <li><ul>Browser information: 
                                <li>navigator property that returns a reference to the Navigator object. Navigator contains information 
                                    about the browser being used. </li>
                                <li>location property is an object that contains informations about the URL of the current page. href 
                                    property returns the full URL as a string. protocol property returns a string describing the protocol 
                                    (ie http, https, etc). host property returns a string describing the domain and port number. hostname 
                                    returns string describing domain. port returns a string describing the port number. pathname returns 
                                    a string of the path that follows the domain. </li>
                        </ul></li>
                        <li>Broswer history: window.history can be used to access informatin anout previously visited pages in the current 
                            browsing session. window.history.length shows how many pages have been visited. window.history.go() can be 
                            used to go to a specific page.</li>
                        <li>Controlling Windows: new window can be opened using window.open() method.</li>
                        <li>Screen Information: window.screen object contains information about the screen being used. The height and width 
                            can be found by using window.screen.height and window.screen.width. On mobile devices we can also use window.screen 
                            to find out screen orientation and locked position.</li>
                        <li>Document Object: document.write(message); writes a string of text to the page. This is something we should hardly, if ever, need to use.</li>
                        <li>Cookies: small files saved locally on a user's computer. They are limited to storing 4KB of data and 20 cookies are allowed per domain.
                            To create cookies- document.cookie = 'value=pair'. To see the current contents of the cookie jar just enter document.cookie
                        </li>
                        <li><ul>Timing functions:
                                <li>setTimeout() method accepts a callback to a function as the first parameter and the number of milliseconds as it's second parameter.</li>
                                <li>clearTimeout() method can clear an alert</li>
                                <li>setInterval() methos is similar to setTimeout() but it will repeatedly invoke the callback every given number of milliseconds.</li>
                        </ul> </li>
                        <li>Animation: CSS is better to use but JS can be used too.</li>
                    </ul>
                <h3>JavaScript: Novice to Ninja - Chapter 14: HTML5 APIs</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>data attribute- a way of embedding data in a web page using custom attributes that are ignored by the browser and private to the page. The name 
                            can be chosen by the developer but has to start with data-, contain only lowecase letters, numbers, hyphens, dots, colons or underscores; and 
                            include an optional string value. Example: data-powers = 'flight'</li>
                        <li>Web Storage aka localStorage- similar to cookies but with fewer limitations, more storage and easier to use. Info stored is not shared with the server on every 
                            request. Info is available on multiple windows is domain is the same. Most browsers have a 5KB storage limit but there isn't technically a 
                            limit. Data does not expire  like it does with cookies. There is also a sessionStorage object that works similarly to localStorage. To store 
                            a value in localStorage: localStorage.getItem('item'); the item can be removed with localStorage.removeItem('item'); or cleared with localStorage.clear();</li>
                        <li>Geolocation-used to obtain the global position of the device. Permission has to be granted first because of privacy concerns. 
                            navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(youAreHere); It returns a latitude and longitude of coordinates.</li>
                        <li>Position also has speed, altitude, heading and timestamp properties</li>
                        <li>Web workers-allow processes to be run in the background, especially if they take along time so that the site does not crash.</li>
                        <li>Video and audio can be added to a page now when it had to be done with flash before.</li>
                        <li>Audio and video methods include play, pause, valuse, mutes, currentTime, playbackRate, loop, and duration.</li>
                    </ul>
