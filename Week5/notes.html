                <h3>JavaScript: Novice to Ninja - Chapter 10: Testing and Debugging</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Errors are usually caused by one of three things: system error, programmer error, or 
                            user error. A system error is when there is a problem with the system or devices that 
                            the program interacts with. A programmer error is incorrect syntax or faulty logic, 
                            forgetting or adding teh wrong symbol. A user error is when the user entered data 
                            incorrectly and the program doesn't know how to handle it. </li>
                        <li>User errors can be minimized by the programmer predicting errors that could be made 
                            and then preventing those errors.</li>
                        <li>Exceptions are caused when something isn't there to access like calling a function 
                            that hasn't been written yet.</li>
                        <li>Stack trace: a sequence of function or method calls that lead to the root of the error.</li>
                        <li>A program can still work when a warning is issued but it is unwise to do so, as the 
                            program will continue to run incorrectly and pay cause problems later in the code.</li>
                        <li><b>Fail loudly in in development</b> so that any errors can be fixed before the program 
                            fails silently later on. To do this a programmer needs to test rigorously.</li>
                        <li>Writing a code in strict mode may seem like it will cause more problems at first but in 
                            the long run the program will run faster and be better quality. To use strict mode: 
                            'use strict'; Strict mode can also be used inside individual functions. Modules are in 
                            strict mode by default.</li>
                        <li>Linting tools will point out sloppy programming and enforce a style guide. Online 
                            recources are JS Lint, JS Hint, and ES Lint.</li>
                        <li>Using feature detection would allow me to check if a users device is able to handle 
                            something in particular, if it is then it will call the method, if not it will fail 
                            gracefully and not throw exceptions. Modernizr and Can I Use? are good resources to 
                            check what features are being supported.</li>
                        <li>Adding alerts can add breakpoints, checking if things have worked up to a certain 
                            point, before moving on. Console.log doesn't stop or pause the program but still 
                            shows the results as they occur. Remove all debugging instances before 'shipping' 
                            a program or in my case, turning it in.</li>
                        <li>An error object can be created to show a message when an error occurs. Errors have 
                            properties, the three properties that are always safe to use are name (name of 
                            error constrictor), message (description of the error) and stack (stack trace for error). </li>
                        <li>When exceptions occur the program terminates with an error message. In development this allows 
                            programmers to see potential problems, but to a user it will appear that the program crashed 
                            and that doesn't reflect well.</li>
                        <li>try, catch and finally allow the code to run as normal but passes the error to the catch block.</li>
                        <li>Create rigorous tests to work out kinks, errors, or mistakes.</li>
                        <li>TDD or test driven development is writing teh test before writing the code so that initially 
                            nothing passes. As the code is written it will continuously be tested and eventually pass. 
                            After passing the code can be made faster, easier to read, and remove repitition. The stepes 
                            of TDD are 1-Write tests that initially fail, 2-write code to pass the tests, 3- refactor the 
                            code, 4-test refactored code, and 5-write more tests for new features.</li>
                    </ul>
                <h3>Questions</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Do you use TDD? Do you think as students we should use TDD?</li>
                        <li>Are there other TDD frameworks that you would recommend looking into? (Besides Jest)</li>
